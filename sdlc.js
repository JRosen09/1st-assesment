// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle 
    to be in their correct order.
*/

// 1 Planning
// 2 Analysis of Requirements
// 3 Design
// 4 Implementation
// 5 Testing & Integration
// 6 Maintain

// I need to make an organized list
// a list of the software Development lifecycle
// and put them into the correct order
// I can use and array to list them and log them out but did not not ask to code.
// used opt arrow to move after numberings which step comes first

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle 
    and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
// will define & give a varible of each step in the software developmet lifecycle
// will use only one word to represent each step
// will use opt shit down to make a exact copy of the line(s) and edit info according

const planning =
  "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.";
const analysingRequirements =
  "This is the second step, determines what the application is supposed to do and its requirements..";
const designing =
  "This is the thrid step, determins the way a software application will work .";
const implementning =
  "This is the forth step, in which the actual writing of code takes place .";
const testing =
  "This is the fifth step, in which the application is tested before making it available to the user.";
const maintaining =
  "This is the sixth step, in which the the application is in use but is being fixed of bug that weren't found during the testing phase.";
