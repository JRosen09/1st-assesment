//Directions

//Create a new file called password.js. Write a program that does the following:

//Create a variable called password and set itâ€™s value to a string of your choice.
//Write a conditional statement that checks if the password meets the following constraints:

//At least 10 characters long
//Contains at least one letter and one number
//If the password meets the constraint, console log a success message.

//If the password fails the constraint, console log a failure message.

//Test out your conditional by changing the value of your password variable and running your file!

//if password = at least 10 characters
//AND has at least a number
//consol log success
//else if consol log failure


let password = 0369;

if (password = 10 character && = 1 number){
    console.log(`success`)
}else if({
    console.log(`failure`)
})
